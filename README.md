[GraphQL][graphql] is a data query language developed by Facebook intended to
serve mobile and web application frontends.

_Juniper_ makes it possible to write GraphQL servers in Rust that are
type-safe and blazingly fast. We also try to make declaring and resolving
GraphQL schemas as convenient as possible as Rust will allow.

Juniper does not include a web server - instead it provides building blocks to
make integration with existing servers straightforward. It optionally provides a
pre-built integration for the [Hyper][hyper], [Iron][iron], [Rocket], and [Warp][warp] frameworks, including
embedded [Graphiql][graphiql] and [GraphQL Playground][playground] for easy debugging.

- [Cargo crate](https://crates.io/crates/juniper)
- [API Reference][docsrs]
- [Book][book]: Guides and Examples

## Getting Started

The best place to get started is the [Juniper Book][book], which contains
guides with plenty of examples, covering all features of Juniper. (very much WIP)

To get started quickly and get a feel for Juniper, check out the
[Quickstart][book_quickstart] section.

For specific information about macros, types and the Juniper api, the
[API Reference][docsrs] is the best place to look.

You can also check out [src/tests/schema.rs][test_schema_rs] to see a complex
schema including polymorphism with traits and interfaces.
For an example of web framework integration,
see the [hyper][hyper_examples], [rocket][rocket_examples], [iron][iron_examples], and [warp][warp_examples] examples folders.

## Features

Juniper supports the full GraphQL query language according to the
[specification][graphql_spec], including interfaces, unions, schema
introspection, and validations.
It does not, however, support the schema language.

As an exception to other GraphQL libraries for other languages, Juniper builds
non-null types by default. A field of type `Vec<Episode>` will be converted into
`[Episode!]!`. The corresponding Rust type for e.g. `[Episode]` would be
`Option<Vec<Option<Episode>>>`.

## Integrations

### Data types

Juniper has automatic integration with some very common Rust crates to make
building schemas a breeze. The types from these crates will be usable in
your Schemas automatically.

- [uuid][uuid]
- [url][url]
- [chrono][chrono]

### Web Frameworks

- [hyper][hyper]
- [rocket][rocket]
- [iron][iron]
- [warp][warp]

## Guides & Examples

- [Juniper + actix-web example](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/juniper)

## API Stability

Juniper has not reached 1.0 yet, thus some API instability should be expected.
