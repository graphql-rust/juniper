# Adding A Server

To allow using Juniper with the HTTP server of your choice,
it does **not** come with a built in HTTP server.

To actually get a server up and running, there are multiple official and 
third-party integration crates that will get you there.

- [Official Server Integrations](official.md)
    - [Warp](warp.md)
    - [Rocket](rocket.md)
    - [Iron](iron.md)
    - [Hyper](hyper.md)
- [Third Party Integrations](third-party.md)
    - [Actix-Web](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/graphql/juniper)
    - [Finchers](https://github.com/finchers-rs/finchers-juniper)
    - [Tsukuyomi](https://github.com/tsukuyomi-rs/tsukuyomi/tree/master/examples/juniper)
