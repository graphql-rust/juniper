Input objects
=============

> A [GraphQL input object][0] defines a set of input fields; the input fields are either [scalars][12], [enums][10], or other [input objects][0]. This allows [arguments][5] to accept arbitrarily complex structs.

In [Juniper], defining a [GraphQL input object][0] is quite straightforward and similar to how [trivial GraphQL objects are defined](objects/index.md) - by using the [`#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]` attribute][2] on a [Rust struct][struct]:
```rust
# #![expect(unused_variables, reason = "example")]
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, GraphQLObject, graphql_object};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
struct Coordinate {
    latitude: f64,
    longitude: f64,
}

struct Root;
# #[derive(GraphQLObject)] struct User { name: String }

#[graphql_object]
impl Root {
    fn users_at_location(coordinate: Coordinate, radius: f64) -> Vec<User> {
        // Send coordinate to database
        // ...
#       unimplemented!()
    }
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

[`@oneOf`] [input objects][0] could be defined by using the [`#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]` attribute][2] on a [Rust enum][enum]:
```rust
# #![expect(unused_variables, reason = "example")]
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, ID};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
enum UserBy {
    Id(ID),       // Every `enum` variant declares a `Null`able input object field,
    Name(String), // so there is no need to use `Option<String>` explicitly.
}
#
# fn main() {}
```


### Renaming

Just as with [defining GraphQL objects](objects/index.md#renaming), by default [struct] fields (or [enum] variants) are converted from [Rust]'s standard naming convention into [GraphQL]'s `camelCase` convention:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, ID};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
struct Person {
    first_name: String, // exposed as `firstName` in GraphQL schema
    last_name: String,  // exposed as `lastName` in GraphQL schema
}

#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
enum UserBy {
    Id(ID),       // exposed as `id` in GraphQL schema
    Name(String), // exposed as `name` in GraphQL schema
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

We can override the name by using the `#[graphql(name = "...")]` attribute:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, ID};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
#[graphql(name = "WebPerson")] // now exposed as `WebPerson` in GraphQL schema
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    #[graphql(name = "websiteURL")]
    website_url: Option<String>, // now exposed as `websiteURL` in GraphQL schema
}

#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
#[graphql(name = "By")] // now exposed as `By` in GraphQL schema
enum UserBy {
    #[graphql(name = "ID")]
    Id(ID),       // now exposed as `ID` in GraphQL schema
    Name(String), 
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

Or provide a different renaming policy for all the [struct] fields:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, ID};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
#[graphql(rename_all = "none")] // disables any renaming
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    website_url: Option<String>, // exposed as `website_url` in GraphQL schema
}

#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
#[graphql(rename_all = "none")] // disables any renaming
enum UserBy {
    Id(ID),       // exposed as `Id` in GraphQL schema
    Name(String), // exposed as `Name` in GraphQL schema
}
#
# fn main() {}
```
> **TIP**: Supported policies are: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, `snake_case`, `camelCase` and `none` (disables any renaming).


### Documentation and deprecation

Similarly, [GraphQL input fields][1] may also be [documented][7] and [deprecated][9] via `#[graphql(description = "...")]` and `#[graphql(deprecated = "...")]`/[`#[deprecated]`][13] attributes:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, ID};
#
/// This doc comment is visible only in Rust API docs.
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
#[graphql(description = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
struct Person {
    /// This doc comment is visible only in Rust API docs.
    #[graphql(desc = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
    //        ^^^^ shortcut for a `description` argument
    name: String,

    /// This doc comment is visible in both Rust API docs and GraphQL schema 
    /// descriptions.
    // Only `Null`able input fields or non-`Null` input fields with default values
    // can be deprecated.
    #[graphql(default, deprecated = "Just because.")]
    age: i32,

    // If no explicit deprecation reason is provided,
    // then the default "No longer supported" one is used.
    #[deprecated]
    another: Option<f64>, // has no description in GraphQL schema
}

/// This doc comment is visible only in Rust API docs.
#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
#[graphql(description = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
enum UserBy {
    /// This doc comment is visible only in Rust API docs.
    #[graphql(desc = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
    //        ^^^^ shortcut for a `description` argument
    Id(ID),

    /// This doc comment is visible in both Rust API docs and GraphQL schema 
    /// descriptions.
    // `enum` variants represent `Null`able input fields already, so can be naturally
    // deprecated without any default values.
    #[graphql(deprecated = "Just because.")]
    Name(String),

    // If no explicit deprecation reason is provided,
    // then the default "No longer supported" one is used.
    #[deprecated]
    Bio(String), // has no description in GraphQL schema
}
#
# fn main() {}
```
> **NOTE**: Only [GraphQL input object][0]/[object][8]/[interface][11] fields, [arguments][5] and [GraphQL enum][10] values can be [deprecated][9].


### Ignoring

By default, all [struct] fields (or [enum] variants) are included into the generated [GraphQL input object][0] type. To prevent inclusion of a specific field/variant annotate it with the `#[graphql(ignore)]` attribute:
> **WARNING**: Ignored fields must either implement `Default` or be annotated with the `#[graphql(default = <expression>)]` argument.
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInputObject, ID};
#
enum System {
    Cartesian,
}

#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    #[graphql(ignore, default = System::Cartesian)]
    //                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    // This attribute is required, as we need to be able to construct
    // a `Point2D` value from the `{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }` GraphQL input value,
    // received from client-side.
    system: System,
    // `Default::default()` value is used, if no 
    // `#[graphql(default = <expression>)]` is specified.
    #[graphql(skip)]
    //        ^^^^ alternative naming, up to your preference
    shift: f64, 
}

#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]
enum UserBy {
    Id(ID),
    // Ignored `enum` variants naturally doesn't require `Default` implementation or
    // `default` value being specified, as they're just never constructed from an input.
    #[graphql(ignore)]
    Name(String),
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

> **TIP**: See more available features in the API docs of the [`#[derive(GraphQLInputObject)]`][2] attribute.
