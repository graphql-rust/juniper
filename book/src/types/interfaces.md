Interfaces
==========

> [GraphQL interfaces][0] represent a list of named [fields][4] and their [arguments][5]. [GraphQL objects][10] and [interfaces][0] can then implement these [interfaces][0] which requires that the implementing type will define all [fields][4] defined by those [interfaces][0].

[GraphQL interfaces][0] map well to interfaces known from common object-oriented languages such as Java or C#, but [Rust], unfortunately, has no concept that maps perfectly to them. The nearest analogue of [GraphQL interfaces][0] are [Rust traits][20], but the main difference is that in [GraphQL] an [interface type][0] serves both as an _abstraction_ and a _boxed value (dispatchable to concrete implementers)_, while in [Rust], a [trait][20] is an _abstraction only_, and _to represent such a boxed value a separate type is required_, like a [trait object][21] or an [enum][22] consisting of implementer types, because [Rust trait][20] doesn't represent a type itself, and so, can have no values.

Another notable difference is that [GraphQL interfaces][0] are more like [structurally-typed][30] contracts: they _only declare a list of [fields][4]_ a [GraphQL] type should already have. [Rust traits][20], on the other hand, are [type classes][31], which don't really care about existing methods, but, rather, _require to provide implementations for required methods_ despite the fact whether the type already has such methods or not. This difference makes the [trait implementation][23] not a good fit for expressing a [GraphQL interface][0] implementation, because _we don't really need to implement any [fields][4]_, the [GraphQL] type implementing a [GraphQL interface][0] has those [fields][4] already. _We only need to check that [fields'][4] signatures match_.

That's why [Juniper] takes the following approach to represent [GraphQL interfaces][0], which consists of two parts:
1. Either a [struct][24], or a [trait][20] (in case [fields][4] have [arguments][5]), which acts only as a blueprint describing the required list of [fields][4], and is not used in runtime at all.
2. An auto-generated [enum][22], representing a dispatchable value-type for the [GraphQL interfaces][0], which may be referred and returned by other [fields][4].

This may be done by using either the [`#[graphql_interface]` attribute][3] or the [`#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]`][2]:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{GraphQLInterface, GraphQLObject, graphql_interface};
#
// By default a `CharacterValue` enum is generated by macro to represent
// values of this GraphQL interface.
#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(for = Human)] // enumerating all implementers is mandatory
struct Character {
    id: String,
}

// Using a trait to describe the required fields is fine too. 
#[graphql_interface]
#[graphql(enum = HasHomeEnum, for = Human)]
//        ^^^^ the generated value-type enum can be renamed, if required
trait HasHome {
    fn home_planet(&self) -> &str;
}

#[derive(GraphQLObject)]
#[graphql(impl = [CharacterValue, HasHomeEnum])] 
//                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^
// Notice the enum type names, neither the trait name nor the struct name
// is used to refer the GraphQL interface.
struct Human {
  id: String,          // also resolves `Character.id` field
  home_planet: String, // also resolves `HasHome.homePlanet` field
}
#
# fn main() {}
```


### Interfaces implementing other interfaces

[GraphQL] allows implementing [interfaces][0] on other [interfaces][0] in addition to [objects][10]:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{graphql_object, GraphQLInterface, ID};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(for = [HumanValue, Luke])]
struct Node {
    id: ID,
}

#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(impl = NodeValue, for = Luke)]
struct Human {
    id: ID,
    home_planet: String,
}

struct Luke {
    id: ID,
}

#[graphql_object]
#[graphql(impl = [HumanValue, NodeValue])]
impl Luke {
    fn id(&self) -> &ID {
        &self.id
    }

    // As `String` and `&str` aren't distinguished by GraphQL spec and 
    // represent the same `!String` GraphQL scalar, we can use them 
    // interchangeably. The same is applied for `Cow<'a, str>`.
    //                  ⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄
    fn home_planet() -> &'static str {
        "Tatooine"
    }
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

> **NOTE**: Every [interface][0] has to specify all other [interfaces][0]/[objects][0] it implements or implemented for. Missing one of `for = ` or `impl = ` attribute arguments is a **compile-time error**.
> ```rust,compile_fail
> # extern crate juniper;
> # use juniper::{GraphQLInterface, GraphQLObject};
> #
> #[derive(GraphQLObject)]
> pub struct ObjA {
>     id: String,
> }
>
> #[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
> #[graphql(for = ObjA)]
> //        ^^^^^^^^^^ the evaluated program panicked at 
> // 'Failed to implement interface `Character` on `ObjA`: missing interface 
> //  reference in implementer's `impl` attribute.'
> struct Character {
>   id: String,
> }
> #
> # fn main() {}
> ```


### Subtyping and additional `null`able arguments

[GraphQL] allows implementers (both [objects][10] and other [interfaces][0]) to return "subtypes" instead of an original value. Basically, this allows to impose additional bounds on the implementation.

Valid "subtypes" are:
- [interface][0] implementer instead of an [interface][0] itself:
  - `I implements T` in place of a `T`;
  - `Vec<I implements T>` in place of a `Vec<T>`.
- [non-`null`][6] value in place of a `null`able:
  - `T` in place of a `Option<T>`;
  - `Vec<T>` in place of a `Vec<Option<T>>`.

These rules are recursively applied, so `Vec<Vec<I implements T>>` is a valid "subtype" of a `Option<Vec<Option<Vec<Option<T>>>>>`.

Also, [GraphQL] allows implementers to add `null`able [field arguments][5], which aren't present on an original interface.

```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{graphql_interface, graphql_object, GraphQLInterface, ID};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(for = [HumanValue, Luke])]
struct Node {
    id: ID,
}

#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(for = HumanConnectionValue)]
struct Connection {
    nodes: Vec<NodeValue>,
}

#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(impl = NodeValue, for = Luke)]
struct Human {
    id: ID,
    home_planet: String,
}

#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(impl = ConnectionValue)]
struct HumanConnection {
    nodes: Vec<HumanValue>,
    //         ^^^^^^^^^^ notice not `NodeValue`
    // This can happen, because every `Human` is a `Node` too, so we just
    // impose additional bounds, which still can be resolved with
    // `... on Connection { nodes }` syntax.
}

struct Luke {
    id: ID,
}

#[graphql_object]
#[graphql(impl = [HumanValue, NodeValue])]
impl Luke {
    fn id(&self) -> &ID {
        &self.id
    }
    
    fn home_planet(language: Option<String>) -> &'static str {
        //                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        // Notice additional `null`able field argument, which is missing on 
        // `Human`. Resolving `...on Human { homePlanet }` will provide `None` 
        // for this argument (default argument value).
        match language.as_deref() {
            None | Some("en") => "Tatooine",
            Some("ko") => "타투인",
            _ => unimplemented!(),
        }
    }
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

> **NOTE**: Violating [GraphQL] "subtyping" or additional `null`able [argument][5] rules is a **compile-time error**.

### Default arguments

[Similarly to GraphQL object fields](objects/complex_fields.md#default-arguments), [GraphQL arguments][4] of [interfaces][0] are able to have default values, though [Rust] doesn't have such notion:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::graphql_interface;
#
#[graphql_interface]
trait Person {
    fn field1(
        // Default value can be any valid Rust expression, including a function
        // call, etc.
        #[graphql(default = true)]
        arg1: bool,
        // If default expression is not specified, then the `Default::default()` 
        // value is used.
        #[graphql(default)]
        arg2: i32,
    ) -> String;
}
#
# fn main() {}
```


### Renaming

Just as with [defining GraphQL objects](objects/index.md#renaming), by default, [fields][4] are converted from [Rust]'s standard `snake_case` naming convention into [GraphQL]'s `camelCase` convention:

We can override the name by using the `#[graphql(name = "...")]` attribute:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::{graphql_interface, GraphQLInterface};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
#[graphql(name = "CharacterInterface")]
struct Character { // exposed as `CharacterInterface` in GraphQL schema
    #[graphql(name = "myCustomFieldName")]
    renamed_field: bool, // exposed as `myCustomFieldName` in GraphQL schema
}

#[graphql_interface]
#[graphql(name = "PersonInterface")]
trait Person { // exposed as `PersonInterface` in GraphQL schema
    #[graphql(name = "myCustomFieldName")]
    fn renamed_field( // exposed as `myCustomFieldName` in GraphQL schema
        #[graphql(name = "myArgument")]
        renamed_argument: bool, // exposed as `myArgument` in GraphQL schema
    ) -> bool;
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

Or provide a different renaming policy for all the defined [fields][4]:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::graphql_interface;
#
#[graphql_interface]
#[graphql(rename_all = "none")] // disables any renaming
trait Person {
    fn renamed_field( // exposed as `renamed_field` in GraphQL schema
        renamed_argument: bool, // exposed as `renamed_argument` in GraphQL schema
    ) -> bool;
}
#
# fn main() {}
```
> **TIP**: Supported policies are: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, `camelCase` and `none` (disables any renaming).


### Documentation and deprecation

Similarly, [GraphQL fields][4] of [interfaces][0] may also be [documented][7] and [deprecated][9] via `#[graphql(description = "...")]` and `#[graphql(deprecated = "...")]`/[`#[deprecated]`][13] attributes:
```rust
# extern crate juniper;
# use juniper::graphql_interface;
#
/// This doc comment is visible only in Rust API docs.
#[graphql_interface]
#[graphql(description = "This description overwrites the one from doc comment.")]
trait Person {
    /// This doc comment is visible only in Rust API docs.
    #[graphql(description = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
    fn empty() -> &'static str;
    
    #[graphql(desc = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
    //        ^^^^ shortcut for a `description` argument
    fn field(
        #[graphql(desc = "This description is visible only in GraphQL schema.")]
        arg: bool,
    ) -> bool;

    /// This doc comment is visible in both Rust API docs and GraphQL schema 
    /// descriptions.
    #[graphql(deprecated = "Just because.")]
    fn deprecated_graphql() -> bool;
    
    // Standard Rust's `#[deprecated]` attribute works too!
    #[deprecated(note = "Reason is optional, btw!")]
    fn deprecated_standard() -> bool; // has no description in GraphQL schema
}
#
# fn main() {}
```
> **NOTE**: Only [GraphQL interface][0]/[object][10] fields and [GraphQL enum][11] values can be [deprecated][9].


### Ignoring

By default, all [struct][24] fields or [trait][20] methods are considered as [GraphQL fields][4]. If a helper method is needed, or it should be ignored for some reason, then it should be marked with the `#[graphql(ignore)]` attribute:
```rust
# #![allow(dead_code)]
# extern crate juniper;
# use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
# use juniper::{graphql_interface, GraphQLInterface};
#
#[derive(GraphQLInterface)]
struct Character {
    id: i32,
    #[graphql(ignore)]
    _pin: PhantomPinned,
}

#[graphql_interface]
trait Person {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;

    fn age(&self) -> i32;

    #[graphql(ignore)]
    fn hidden_from_graphql(&self) {
        // Ignored methods are allowed to have a default implementation!
    }

    #[graphql(skip)]
    //        ^^^^ alternative naming, up to your preference
    fn also_hidden_from_graphql(&self);
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

> **TIP**: See more available features in the API docs of the [`#[graphql_interface]`][3] attribute.
