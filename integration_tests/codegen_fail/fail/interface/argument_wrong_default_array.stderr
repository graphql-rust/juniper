error[E0277]: the trait bound `[bool; 2]: From<[bool; 3]>` is not satisfied

12 | #[graphql_interface(for = ObjA)]
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<[bool; 3]>` is not implemented for `[bool; 2]`
   |
   = help: the following implementations were found:
             <[T; LANES] as From<Simd<T, LANES>>>
             <[bool; LANES] as From<Mask<T, LANES>>>
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<[bool; 2]>` for `[bool; 3]`
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `graphql_interface` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
