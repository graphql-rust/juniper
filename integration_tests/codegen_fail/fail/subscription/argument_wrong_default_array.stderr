error[E0277]: the trait bound `[bool; 2]: From<[bool; 3]>` is not satisfied
  --> fail/subscription/argument_wrong_default_array.rs:10:1

10 | #[graphql_subscription]
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<[bool; 3]>` is not implemented for `[bool; 2]`
   |
   = help: the following implementations were found:
             <[T; LANES] as From<Simd<T, LANES>>>
             <[bool; LANES] as From<Mask<T, LANES>>>
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<[bool; 2]>` for `[bool; 3]`
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `graphql_subscription` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
