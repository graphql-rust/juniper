- [Changelog](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/blob/master/juniper/CHANGELOG.md)


[GraphQL] is a data query language developed by [Facebook] and intended to serve mobile and web application frontends.

*[Juniper]* makes it possible to write [GraphQL] servers in [Rust] that are type-safe and blazingly fast. We also try to make declaring and resolving [GraphQL] schemas as convenient as possible as [Rust] will allow.

[Juniper] doesn't include a web server - instead it provides building blocks to make integration with existing servers straightforward, including embedded [GraphiQL] and/or [GraphQL Playground] for easy debugging.




## Getting Started

The best place to get started is [Juniper Book], which contains guides with plenty of examples, covering all features of [Juniper].

To get started quickly and get a feel for Juniper, check out the ["Quickstart" section][1].

For specific information about macros, types and the [Juniper] API, the [API docs][Juniper] is the best place to look.




## Features

[Juniper] supports the full [GraphQL] query language according to [October 2021 GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021), including interfaces, unions, schema introspection, and validations. It does not, however, support the schema language.

As an exception to other [GraphQL] libraries for other languages, [Juniper] builds non-`null` types by default. A field of type `Vec<Episode>` will be converted into `[Episode!]!`. The corresponding Rust type for e.g. `[Episode]` would be `Option<Vec<Option<Episode>>>`.




## Integrations


### Data types

[Juniper] has automatic integration with some very common [Rust] crates to make building schemas a breeze. The types from these crates will be usable in your schemas automatically:
- [`bson`]
- [`chrono`] (feature gated)
- [`chrono-tz`] (feature gated)
- [`serde_json`] (`json` feature gated)
- [`time`] (feature gated)
- [`url`]
- [`uuid`]


### Web servers

- [`actix-web`] ([`juniper_actix`] crate)
- [`hyper`] ([`juniper_hyper`] crate)
- [`iron`] ([`juniper_iron`] crate)
- [`rocket`] ([`juniper_rocket`] crate)
- [`warp`] ([`juniper_warp`] crate)




## API Stability

[Juniper] has not reached 1.0 yet, thus some API instability should be expected.
