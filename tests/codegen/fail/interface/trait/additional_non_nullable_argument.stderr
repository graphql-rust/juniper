   |        ^^ the evaluated program panicked at 'Failed to implement interface `Character` on `ObjA`: Field `id`: Argument `isPresent` of type `Boolean!` isn't present on the interface and so has to be nullable.', $DIR/fail/interface/trait/additional_non_nullable_argument.rs:16:8

   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::panic::panic_2021` which comes from the expansion of the macro `::juniper::assert_field` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
