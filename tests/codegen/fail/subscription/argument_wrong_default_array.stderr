   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<[bool; 3]>` is not implemented for `[bool; 2]`

   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             <[bool; LANES] as From<Mask<T, LANES>>>
             <[u32; 4] as From<ppv_lite86::x86_64::vec128_storage>>
             <[u32; 8] as From<ppv_lite86::x86_64::vec256_storage>>
             <[u32; 16] as From<ppv_lite86::x86_64::vec512_storage>>
             <[u64; 2] as From<ppv_lite86::x86_64::vec128_storage>>

             <[u128; 1] as From<ppv_lite86::x86_64::vec128_storage>>
           and $N others
   = note: required for `[bool; 3]` to implement `Into<[bool; 2]>`
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `graphql_subscription` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
