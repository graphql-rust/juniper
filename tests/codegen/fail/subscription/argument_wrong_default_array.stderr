error[E0277]: the trait bound `[bool; 2]: From<[bool; 3]>` is not satisfied

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<[bool; 3]>` is not implemented for `[bool; 2]`

   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             <[bool; N] as From<Mask<T, N>>>
             <[T; N] as From<Simd<T, N>>>
             <[T; 1] as From<(T,)>>
             <[T; 2] as From<(T, T)>>
             <[T; 3] as From<(T, T, T)>>
             <[T; 4] as From<(T, T, T, T)>>
             <[T; 5] as From<(T, T, T, T, T)>>
             <[T; 6] as From<(T, T, T, T, T, T)>>
           and $N others
   = note: required for `[bool; 3]` to implement `Into<[bool; 2]>`
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `graphql_subscription` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
